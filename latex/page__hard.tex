The design of the hardware for our system is split into three primary stages\+: component selection, electronic system design, and mechanical system design. Due to the importance of the P\+CB desing for the ME 507 course, we have given it its own dedicated page.\hypertarget{page__hard_sec_Sel}{}\doxysection{Component Selection}\label{page__hard_sec_Sel}
Our vehicle began with the internals needed to power the vehicle and all the components and then building from the inside out. Each member of our team was comfortable using the Nucleo -\/ S\+T\+M32\+L476\+RG microcontroller and since we all knew that this Nucleo had a large amounts of capability with plenty of input and output pins, we decided to choose it as our main computational unit.

The main determining factor in selecting sensors was the cost. We went with the most affordable sensor That we thought was able to do the job required. We went with one ultrasonic sensor for the longer range of operation and we choose an infrared sensor for its shorter operation range. ~\newline

The final step for the physical design was the mechanical aspect of our Collision Avoidance System Vehicle. When we had proposed our project, Figure 5 was the sketch that we had proposed to design. At the time of the proposal, we had only intended to use an ultrasonic sensor to avoid collisions. After looking at the size of the ultrasonic sensor, adding an infrared sensor, and designing our board to attach to the S\+T\+M32 Nucleo as a shield, our design changed to the one shown in Figure 6. ~\newline
