This project is to implement a Collision Avoidance System on a ground vehicle. The idea, inspired by D\+IY Builder on You\+Tube, is to build a ground vehicle that houses a S\+T\+M32 Nucleo-\/64 development board with S\+T\+M32\+L476\+RG M\+CU, a custom designed P\+CB, an ultrasonic sensor, and an infrared sensor, all powered by a battery pack. The goal is to write code in C++ that will communicate with the vehicle\textquotesingle{}s motors, as well as the two sensors, through the custom designed P\+CB and the Nucleo board to control the the speed of the vehicle in order to avoid colliding with a wall.\hypertarget{index_sec_Prop}{}\doxysection{Original Project Proposal}\label{index_sec_Prop}
